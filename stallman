People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs to use vi. Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance. So happy hacking.

If you want to accomplish something in the world, idealism is not enough--you need to choose a method that works to achieve the goal. In other words, you need to be pragmatic.

Today many people are switching to free software for purely practical reasons. That is good, as far as it goes, but that isn't all we need to do! Attracting users to free software is not the whole job, just the first step.

If in my lifetime the problem of non-free software is solved, I could
perhaps relax and write software again. But I might instead try to
help deal with the world's larger problems. Standing up to an evil

I see nothing unethical in the job it does. Why shouldn't you send a copy of some music to a friend?

'Free software' is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer'.

For personal reasons, I do not browse the web from my computer. (I also have no net connection much of the time.) To look at page I send mail to a daemon which runs wget and mails the page back to me. It is very efficient use of my time, but it is slow in real time.

Proprietary software tends to have malicious features. The point is
with a proprietary program, when the users don't have the source code,

Android is very different from the GNU/Linux operating system because

With paper printed books, you have certain freedoms. You can acquire the book anonymously by paying cash, which is the way I always buy books. I never use a credit card. I don't identify to any database when I buy books. Amazon takes away that freedom.

Also, because schools must teach the spirit of goodwill, the habit of

The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we

The reason that a good citizen does not use such destructive means to

When I launched the development of the GNU system, I explicitly said
the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers
and have freedom, thus if you use some other free system instead but
you have freedom, then it's a success. It's not popularity for our
code but it's success for our goal.

The desire to be rewarded for one's creativity does not justify

In practice, the copyright system does a bad job of supporting
authors, aside from the most popular ones. Other authors' principal

In the US, you even lose legal rights if you store your data in a

anything.

Necrophilia would be my second choice for what should be done with my corpse, the first being scientific or medical use. Once my dead body is no longer of any use to me, it may as well be of some use to someone. Besides, I often enjoy rhinophytonecrophilia (nasal sex with dead plants).

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
