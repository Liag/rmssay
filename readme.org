I wanted a quick command to generate some free software wisdom, who
better than RMS can do this job ? :)

By editing stallman (quotes file) and rms.cow (ascii art) and renaming
the script to your liking you can actually get a generator for
wathever you want.

You can also just do things like


#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fortune myascii | cowsay -f myquotes
#+END_SRC

where myascii and myquotes are in /usr/share/fortune and
/usr/share/cows respectively


* Dependencies

- make (for the install)
- cowsay (to display ASCII rms)
- fortune (to get a random quote from the quote file)

* Improvements

- better ascii art is welcome
- more quotes
